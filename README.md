## Objectives ðŸŽ¯
The objectives of this project are gaining descriptive information and finding the "why's" from the data. To obtain such objectives, 
there are two outputs of this project:

This colab notebook contains detailed thought process (raw code), descriptive statistics, and logical reasoning why certain occurences occur. 
You can see analyzing_stock_market_project.py for raw code only (without outputs)

While this Streamlit Dashboard will interactively show trends of specified timeframe and columns. You can use given .csv file in this branch as an input for dashboard.

**Notes:** Pandas are used as it accounts for [Bessel Correction](https://www.statisticshowto.com/bessels-correction/) on its standar deviation calculation. Thus, it 
fits for this project context that uses sample data.

## Settings
Several things for consideration: **data set**, **cloning the projects**, and **running engine for dashboard**
### Data set
You can either download ```dataset_full.csv``` (already clean) or follow these steps for raw data (on your Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab):
```
  # Install the yfinance API
  !pip install yfinance

  # Import the library
  import yfinance as yf
  dataset = yf.download('BAC', start='2004-01-01', end='2016-01-01')
  dataset
```
### Cloning the projects
You can clone this project to run locally **using Git**. However, note you do not need to push it in this branch. Just do on your own local environment and push on your own Git branches! :D
```
$git config --local user.name "your-display-name"
$git clone https://github.com/raflidzaky/2024-March-stock_market_analysis
$dir 
$cd 2024-March-stock_market_analysis
```

### Running engine
You need an engine to showcase pre-deployed dashboard. Here's how (you could **write in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab**)
```
  !pip install streamlit

  # Initialize file for writing streamlit dashboard
  %%writefile whatever_name.py

  # Run streamlit based on the file on whatever_name.py
  # And run it in localtunnel
  !streamlit run whatever_name.py & npx localtunnel --port your_port_number
```
