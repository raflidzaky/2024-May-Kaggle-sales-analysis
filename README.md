## Project objective ðŸŽ¯
The main objective here is creating inference application (predict sales by TV budget). 
However, I also done the descriptive statistics in Google Colab.

This colab notebook contains detailed thought process, descriptive statistics, and modelling process (such as feature engineering). 
Streamlit link below will interactively predict sales based off model created on Colab notebook

## Settings
### Configuration
First to do, you could clone this project **using Git**. This is how:
```
$git config --local user.name "your-display-name"
$git clone https://github.com/raflidzaky/2024-May-Kaggle-sales-analysis
$dir 
$cd 2024-May-Kaggle-sales-analysis
```

If you yet to install Streamlit, you could install and run it on the virtual environment. 
```
cd .venv\streamlit_app_management

pip install poetry

poetry shell
```

You are not required to do re-configuration from scratch (such as re-creating the ```pyproject.toml```), since the existing pyproject.toml will help you to keep up with dependencies I used.

### Run Streamlit on local
If you wanna run Streamlit on local, you just change direction to parent folder and do a command
```
cd \streamlit_app

streamlit run app.py
```
